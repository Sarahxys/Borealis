I used the scafold sequence as input query for Primer Blast. Specified that the forward primer range as 961-1049 and reverse primer range as 14001509.
The top 10 primers were shown. I went through them manually to see which one is the best base on the following criteria:
  - doesn't start with long "TTTT"
  - have lower number of self-completarity
  - melting point closer to 60C as possible
  - reasonable GC content

The below primer pair is the best among the result after consider the above criteria:
